# [Optional] Vagrant

This is an optional project that could be completed as part of the ALX SE Program.
The project is intended to help students setup a **virtual environment** on their local machines using **VirtualBox** (Virtual Machine provider) and **Vagrant**.

This virtual environment will help the student to complete their ALX assessments on their local machines without using the terminal on the sandbox.
